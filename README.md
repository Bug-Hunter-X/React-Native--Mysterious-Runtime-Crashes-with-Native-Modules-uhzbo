This repository demonstrates a problematic React Native integration with a native module. The app will seemingly crash without providing a descriptive error message. The solution involves careful review and adjustment of the native module and how it interfaces with React Native's Javascript environment.  Further investigation and understanding of native Android/iOS development is required for advanced debugging.
