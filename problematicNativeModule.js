This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that has native modules and you encounter issues with linking or bridging the native code.  This is different from the common linking errors you see because it involves issues in how the native module integrates with the React Native environment. This often results in runtime crashes or unexpected behavior that might not show a clear error message in your JS code.  For instance, you may get a blank screen, your app crashes without a stack trace, or some native-dependent features simply don't work.

Example scenario:
Suppose you use a library that interacts with the device camera and the native module implementation for that library has a subtle error in how it handles device permissions or memory management. You will not get a clear error message indicating this.  Debugging such problems needs deep knowledge of both React Native and the native code of the third-party library.
