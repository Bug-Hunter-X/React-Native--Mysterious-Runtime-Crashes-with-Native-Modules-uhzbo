The solution to this type of problem usually requires inspecting the native code (Android Java/Kotlin or iOS Objective-C/Swift) of the problematic library. Look for errors in memory management, resource handling, or unexpected interactions with React Native.  Common issues include:

* Incorrect permissions handling:
Ensure your native module correctly requests and handles necessary device permissions (camera, storage, etc.).
* Memory leaks:
Check for memory leaks within the native code that may lead to crashes or instability.
* Threading issues:
Verify the module handles multithreading correctly, avoiding race conditions or deadlocks.
* React Native bridge problems:
Confirm that the communication between the native module and React Native's Javascript side happens correctly.  Check for proper data marshaling and error handling within the bridge.

In the problematic code, assume a bad interaction that is not readily detected. The solution requires careful examination of the native module's implementation and ensuring all aspects, including interactions with other native modules and React Native bridge operations, are thoroughly addressed.

This often requires a deep understanding of both React Native and the native platforms (Android and iOS). Thorough testing and logging on both Javascript and native sides can help pinpoint the issue.
